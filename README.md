# Convinient Whitelist for Minecraft Servers

This application allows admins and moderator to easily manage a whitelist for their Minecraft server.
Users can be added and removed from the whitelist by simply clicking on a corresponding button in the admin panel.

Users can also be added by registering on the website. They can log in with their minecraft username or via the Microsoft XBox integration.

This is a Prisma, PostgreSQL, and Express application for users to register to a Minecraft server. Admins can accept or reject the applications through an admin panel, which automatically adds or removes the players from the Minecraft Server's whitelist.

## Features

- User registration with Minecraft username
- Admin authentication
- Admin panel for approving or rejecting users
- Automatic Minecraft server whitelist management through RCON

## Future Features
